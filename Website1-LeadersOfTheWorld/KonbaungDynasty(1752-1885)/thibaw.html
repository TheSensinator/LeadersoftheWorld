    <h1><a id="earlylife">Early Life</a></h1>
      <h2>Birth</h2>
        <p>Thibaw was born as 
        <span title="Honorific meaning younger brother"><i>Maung</i></span> Pu (Burmese: <span class="burmese">မောင်ပု</span>). His parents were King Mindon and Laungshe 
        Mibaya, one of Mindon's consorts. King Mindon, being the absolute Chad that he was, had a total of 110 children. Thibaw was his 41st. Thibaw was born on January 
        1, 1859 in Burma's capital at the time, Mandalay. </p>
      <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Laungshe Mibaya, Thibaw's mother, eventually got exhiled from Mindon's 
	palace and spent her last years as a <span title="Kinda like a nun"><i>Thilashin</i></span>. 
        Thibaw spent portions of his early life studying Buddhist texts to earn his father's admiration. 
        To prove his knowledge, he took and passed the <i><span name="Religious examinations">Pahtamabyan</span></i>. 
	Due to passing, he gained his father's respect. One of Mindon's chief 
	consorts, <span title="Title: Queen of the Middle Palace"><i>Hsinbyumashin</span></i> 
	helped organize a marriage between Supayalat, one of her daughters, and Thibaw. 
	Supayalat and Thibaw were half siblings (SWEET HOME, ALABAMA).</p>

      <h2><a id="accession">Accession</a></h2>
	<p>As King Mindon was dying of dysentery, a group of the most powerful members of Burma's court gathered to discuss 
	royal succession. Mindon had refused, up until his death, to name a successor as he didn't want his successor to get 
	murdered. The three primary candidates were the Mekkaya Prince, Nyaungyan, and Thonze (the king's three eldest, still 
	loyal children). The court eliminated all three of them, as each court member had a preferred child that they wanted 
	to put in charge. All members wanted a young, controllable prince in charge. Myoza, one of the most powerful members 
	of the meeting, strongly wanted his grandson Pyinmina to become king. Nyaungyan and Thonze were also suggested by other 
	members of the meeting. Ultimately, the decision went to the king's chief queen, debatably one of the most powerful 
	people in the entire kingdom, Hsinbyumashin.</p>
        <p>Thibaw became king on October 1, 1878 at the age of 19. This was following a massacre initiated by his wife's mother, Hsinbyumashin.
	Hsinbyumashin was the most powerful person in King Mindon's court during the final days of his life. With her large
	influence, she killed all royals around Thibaw's age to guarantee that her daughter would inherit the throne after
	Mindon's death. Due to this, Thibaw and her daughter, Supayalat, inherited the throne. Burma was a fragment of the 
	empire that it once was. The British had conquered the entirety of Lower Burma, so the empire only consisted of 
	central present-day Myanmar.</p>
	<p>Thibaw received the regnal name of Siri Pavara Vijayānanta Yasatiloka Dhipatipaṇdita Mahādhammarājadhirāja (Burmese: 
	<span class="burmese">သိရီပဝရ ဝိဇယာနန္တ ယသတိလောကာ ဓိပတိ ပဏ္ဍိတ မဟာဓမ္မရာဇာဓိရာဇာ</span>). Just a little bit of a mouthful.</p>
      <h2><a id="reforms">Reforms</a></h2>
	<p>During Thibaw's reign, many changes occurred in Burma. For example, a national lottery was established in 1878. This 
	lottery was suggested by Pho Hlaing (Burmese: <span class="burmese">ဘိုးလှိုင်</span>), a noble who had spent time in France (where he experienced the French lottery). 
	Pho Hlaing attempted to have much greater influence then this. He created a treatise called the Rajadhammasangaha 
	(Burmese: <span class="burmese">ရာဇဓမ္မသင်္ဂဟ</span>) which recommended many Buddhist teachings to be implemented for Burma. 
	He advocated for Burma to become a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral parliament which provided representation to 
	everyone. Most of his recommendations stemmed from Britain's style of government. He also blamed overwhelming taxation 
	as the reason that many Burmese people were traveling to British Burma. Unfortunately, this was completely ignored by 
	Burma and none of his suggestions were implemented. Even the lottery was quickly disbanded. This is because of decreased 
	incomes, many families losing everything, and monks criticizing the institution. It had only lasted for two years. From 
	1878 to 1880.</p>
	<p>The lottery was not the only major change that Burma went through under Thibaw. Between October and November of 1878, 
	the size of the <span name="Bicameral Legislature of Burma">Hluttaw</span> was greatly increased from 4 departments to 14.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Agriculture</li>
	  <li>Civil Justice</li>
	  <li>Criminal Justice</li>
	  <li>Foreign Affairs</li>
	  <li>Land Warfare</li>
	  <li>Mechanised Industries</li>
	  <li>Partnerships</li>
	  <li>Public Works</li>
	  <li>Religious Knowledge</li>
	  <li>Royal Estate Management</li>
	  <li>Sassamedha (Personal Taxes)</li>
	  <li>Taxation</li>
	  <li>Town and Village Affairs</li>
	  <li>Water-borne Warfare</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Thibaw also created a new administrative unit. He divided Burma into 10 districts (Burmese: <span class="burmese">ခရိုင်</span>). 
	These districts were inspired by similar divisions in British Burma.</p>
      <h2><a id="3rdabwar">Third Anglo-Burmese War</a></h2>
	<h3><a href="C:/Users/joshu/OneDrive/Documents/Website2-Wars/ThirdAngloBurmeseWar(1885)/thirdanbwar.html">More info</a></h3>
	<h3>Background</h3>
	  <p>Britain had considered war with Burma to finally conquer the entire thing for many years. After the succession crisis that 
	  resulted in Thibaw's reign, Britain officially cut off all diplomatic ties with Burma. They were on the verge of declaring war, 
	  but they had wars in other regions of the world to dedicate their troops to. In following years, Burma began attempting to form 
	  an alliance with France, which greatly worried Britain. In the aftermath of this, a border dispute happened between Burma and 
	  British Burma. In 1881, Britain attempted to solve this problem by hiring a commission to mark out the border between the two 
	  countries. In doing this, many villages were forcibly taken over by the British because they deemed the villages to be a part 
	  of their side. Burmese authorities and the population fiercely objected this, but eventually gave up. In 1885, a Frenchman, 
	  Hass, moved to Mandalay. While there, he attempted to establish a French Bank in Burma, to establish a future railway from 
	  Mandalay to British Burma, and an offer to manage monopolies controlled by the Burmese government. This angered Britain for 
	  obvious reasons, so Britain convinced France to take Hass out of Burma for "reasons of health".</p>
	  <p>Minor incidents also occurred that fostered hatred between Britain and Burma. For example, "The Great Shoe Question" was 
	  an incident in which visiting dignitaries from Britain refused to remove their shoes before entering the royal palace. Because 
	  of this they were banished</p>
	  <p>Along with this, a British corporation (Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation) was accused of lying about the amount of goods 
	  it extracted from Toungoo and refusing to pay its employees. A Burmese court fined the company, but the company and the British 
	  government denied the claims. Then, Britain demanded that Burma accept a British-appointed arbitrator to decide on the dispute. 
	  Then, Britain got butthurt and demanded that Burma submit themselves to Britain. Burma, obviously, declined this deal to give up 
	  their independence entirely. The Third Anglo-Burmese War then commenced.</p>
